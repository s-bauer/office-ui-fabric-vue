            Office Vue Fabric tries to include all available <a
                href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/components"
                target="_blank">Office UI Fabric Components</a> provided by Microsoft. While this goal is not yet
            reached we do our best to continuously add components until we do so. This is a long, but interesting
            journey! Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/s-bauer/office-ui-fabric-vue/issues/17"
                                           target="_blank">Component Progress</a> on GitHub to see which components are
            prioritised and currently being worked on.

            Go check out some of the components by selecting them in the left sidebar. They all contain a little
            playground where you can test them out!
